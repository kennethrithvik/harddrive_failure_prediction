Data centers generally use hard drives as data storage device. Large companies heavily rely on

data and use many hard drives, which become challenging to monitor manually. When there is an

issue with the hard-disk, it should function for at least next 24 hours for the data back-up to be

done. But in ideal cases, the hard-disk fails even before 24 hours resulting in loss of data. Hard

drive failures cause data loss which can cause a serious problem for the users. As backup, multiple

copies of data can be stored in the system, but it might increase the cost at the same time. In

industries, hard drives are monitored by setting threshold for several critical metrics.

1.2. A SSESS S ITUATION

SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) attributes of hard disks can be

useful in detecting the failure rate of the hard-disks. It is useful to predict the hard drive failure by

developing a model, so that it can be used to get useful insights to improve the system reliability

and help cut cost.

1.3. D ATA M INING G OALS

A single hard disk may have up to 30 SMART attributes which may give health information of

the hard disk and provide statistical information about the hard disk. There are machine learning

and statistical methods available to predict hard disk failure based on SMART attributes.
